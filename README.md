# TikTok UI Improvement Project

This project is a part of my preparation for the Frontend Software Engineering Internship at TikTok. The goal was to replicate and improve the user interface of a TikTok-like application, focusing on enhancing user experience and visual design. The project showcases my skills in React.js, CSS, and responsive web design.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Bottom Navigation Bar**: Redesigned the bottom navigation bar for a more sleek and consistent look.
- **SOS Button Integration**: Added an SOS button into the right-side options bar, with a subtle red text color and report count display.
- **Modal Overlay**: Improved the design and layering of the modal for reporting emergencies, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application adapts well to different screen sizes, mimicking a mobile device layout.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **React.js**: Component-based UI library for building the interactive interface.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the components, with a focus on responsive design principles.
- **Vite**: Utilized as the build tool for faster development.
